# Language Modeling

This example shows how to use a pre-trained BERT model for masked language modeling.

```bash
python masked_language_modeling.py
```

You can then enter a sentence and the model will predict the masked words, e.g.:

- I'm so <mask> to talk about this topic!
- Berlin is the capital of <mask> .
- Go is a modern <mask> language <mask> for its ability to <mask> high-concurrency tasks.
